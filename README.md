# Python Voice Assistant Project (Alexa Emulation):
- This project is written in Python 3.10 coding language.
-  This project is meant to be an emulation of a working Alexa System.
-  Skills shown and used include:
  - - function creation
  - - Python Module/Library importation
  - - try and except functions
  - - for and while loops
  
  ## Required Python Modules for Functionality:
  - SpeechRecognition
  - pyttsx3 
  - pywhatkit (TBD)
  - datetime (TBD)
  - wikipedia (TBD)
  - pyjokes (TBD)

## Problem Log:
- Upon running the code, the emulator simply responds with "please repeat the command" and does not take voice input
  - Addressing the problem by implementing different architecture (compare files voice_assisstant.py and va2.py)
  - Planning to bridge pyttsx3 and speech_recognition interfaces
